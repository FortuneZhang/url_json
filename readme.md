this lib is use for filter button, if you are chinese, you can visit jd.com

Require:
    jquery (I import them in my lib'
    bootstrap ( also import them)

Usage:
    there is an example in my lib, example.html
    you can read it, but when you don't like mine ,you can read js file for write yourself.

    if you want jump like jd.com, when you click button, you should change onclick method.
    from URL_JSON_RELATION.mark_me_selected(this) to URL_JSON_RELATION.mark_me_selected_then_redirect(this).

    for example : you are on google.com, when you click , it will redirect to google.com?hello=world.
    I don't use it for you can transfer params in post method.

    just do data = URL_JSON_RELATION.get_json().

    that's all, have a nice day!
